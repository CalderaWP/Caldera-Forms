= Are My Caldera Forms Going to Display Properly on All Types of Devices? =

Yes. Caldera forms is responsive by design. With Caldera Forms' drag and drop layout editor, you can easily create multi-column layouts for desktop that will display properly on mobile devices thanks to our responsive bootstrap-driven design.

= Is Caldera Forms Protected Against Spam? =

Yes your forms are protected against spam submissions by default. We use a honeypot instead of a captcha because captchas are less effective than honeypots and captchas are bad for conversions.   You can also use our [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) processor for anti-spam, which is available when Akismet is active on your site. You can also use [Spam Shield](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-spamshield/).   On our own sites, we just use the default anti-spam and we find this to be over 99% effective.

= Can I Send One or More Emails With Each Form Submission? =

Yes, we have many options for sending emails on each submission of your form. Caldera Forms provides an [email notification](https://calderaforms.com/doc/setting-caldera-forms-email-notification?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms), which is turned on by default. In addition you can add one or more [auto-responder processors](https://calderaforms.com/doc/using-caldera-forms-auto-responder-processor?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) to your forms.

= Why Is Caldera Form So Awesome? Seriously, Even Its Free Version Has So Many Great Features! =

Because we are awesome:)   We set out to make a different kind of WordPress form builder.

It's no secret that there are a lot of established leaders in this field. But we think that by starting with no conceptions of what a WordPress form builder should be or how it works, we were able to make something special.   We strive to provide a solid core product that can be used for free in hopes that you will use it, and think it is awesome. If you would like to support our work please consider purchasing one of our [Caldera Forms add-ons](https://calderaforms.com/caldera-forms-add-ons?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms), a [cost-saving Caldera Forms bundles](https://calderaforms.com/caldera-forms-bundles/?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) or one of our other fine WordPress plugins including [Easy Pods](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-easy-pods/), [Easy Queries](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-easy-queries/) and [Ingot](https://IngotHQ.com).  

= How Can I Send an Email to More Than One Person?  =

There are a lot of ways to send more than one email with Caldera Forms.

 If you'd like to send two different emails, for example, one email with all of the submission details to the site owner and an auto-response message to the person who filled out the form. In this situation, you can use the main email notification to send to you and then use the [auto-responder processor](https://calderaforms.com/doc/using-caldera-forms-auto-responder-processor?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) to send a simple "thank you, we will be in touch" message to the person who filled out the form.

 If you use the starter contact for form template to create a form this is already set up for you. Simply add your email address as the recipient in the email tab and you're ready to go.   You can add more than one auto-responder processor to your form. Since these processors can make use of Caldera Forms conditional logic, you can add multiple auto-responder processors and set them to run or not run based on form input.

= How Can I Save And View Forms Submissions? =

 Form submission tracking in your WordPress database, is a core feature of Caldera Forms.

 Tracking the entries from your forms is turned on for forms by default. You can turn it off from the settings tab of the form editor. When enabled all form entry data, with certain exceptions -- such as credit card numbers -- for security reasons, is saved.   You can view this information from the Caldera Forms admin page. You may optionally enable, form the form settings tab, a sub-menu page of the Caldera Forms menu page that will show entry data. You can choose to make these sub-menu pages available to users of other roles besides admins.  

= Can You Use Caldera Forms to Create a Event Registration Form? =

 Oh yes you can. Caldera forms is excellent for this if you need to accept payments for the event, you can use one of our [many payment processors](https://calderaforms.com/caldera-forms-add-ons?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms). If you need to register users, you can use our [users add-on](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-forms-users-add?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms).  

= Can I Use Caldera Forms For Front-end Editing Of Users? =

Yes, you can. Our [users add-on](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-forms-users-add?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) can register users, login users and even be used to edit user profiles. [Matt Cromwell](https://www.mattcromwell.com/) has [an excellent tutorial](https://www.mattcromwell.com/building-front-end-profile-editor-caldera-forms/) on using Caldera Forms for front-end editing of user profiles.  

= Can I Use Caldera Forms For Front-end Editing Of Posts? =

Yes, you can. Our plugin [Caldera Custom Fields ](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-form-metabox?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms)allows you to use Caldera Forms to edit or create posts of any post type, and their custom fields. [Mike Hemberger](http://thestizmedia.com) has an [excellent post on creating a WordPress front-end editor with Caldera Forms](http://thestizmedia.com/front-end-post-editing-with-caldera-forms/).  

= Does Caldera Form Support Multi Page Forms? =

Oh, yes it does. By default Caldera Forms supports multi-page forms.  This is a core feature of Caldera Forms.

In the Caldera Forms form builder, there is a "Add Page" button, click that to add a page to your form. The Caldera Forms form builder supports adding as many pages as you want to your form, but don't get carried away. No one likes a form with too many pages!

Multi-page forms are loaded on one page. This way of creating multi-page forms is simple to use and excellent for shorter, less complicated forms. We also offer a[ Connected Forms add-on](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-forms-connector?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms), which allow you to combine multiple Caldera Forms into a sequence of forms. The advantage of this method is that a connected form sequence can have conditional logic.  So for example, if one form asks your user select that they want to pay now or pay later, you can take them to a credit card payment form or a form to arrange payment details.

In addition, Connected Forms tracks partial submissions between each step in the form sequence allow users to come back to where they left off in the sequence.

= Does Caldera Forms Create Accessible WordPress Forms ? =
Some form builder plugins require an [add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-wcag-20-form-fields/) to make their forms accessible to those with disabilities. That seems silly. Caldera Forms is committed to making the most accessible form builder possible. We do our best to add all necessary [ARIA tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) tags, use semantic markup and the correct title attributes. In addition Caldera Forms is 100% translation friendly.

If you see a way Caldera Forms could be a more accessible form builder, please open an issue. We are currently working to address several remaining [accessibility issues](https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAccesibility) and are always on the look out for other ways to improve our form builder so all vistors to your WordPress site are able to interact with your beautiful WordPress forms.

= Does Caldera Forms Have File Upload Fields? =
The Caldera Forms form builder has two types of file upload fields. Basic file fields let you add file uploads to your WordPress forms using the browser's native form file fields. Advanced File Upload Fields are fancier form fields that you can add with our form builder. These form fields have a btter user interface.

 The basic File Upload Field pptions in Caldera Forms let visitors to your WordPress site upload fields allow your users to add one or more files. Multiple uploads can be enabled with the “Allow Multiple” option.

 These files become attachments in the WordPress media library, and can optionally be attached to emails sent with the Caldera Forms mailer. Attaching to emails is enabled with the “Attach To Mailer” option.

 If your form allows public submissions, care should be used with what file types are allowed. Allowed extensions can be entered into the “Allowed Types” option field, as a comma separated list of allowed extensions. For example, “jpg,png,gif” would limit to images of those types, while “pdf” would only allow PDFs.

 Native file upload fields are impossible to add custom CSS to. Also, while they do handle multiple file uploads, their handling off multiple files is not graceful. With a regular file field that is set to accept multiple files, all files must be added using the same file upload window, which is not good.

 Caldera Forms file fields can only use the file types that are allowed by WordPress and your server configuration. For more information on how to modify which file types WordPress allows, [see this article](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-additional-file-types-to-be-uploaded-in-wordpress/).

 These limitations can be avoided by switching to an [Advanced File Upload Field](https://calderaforms.com/doc/advanced-file-field/).

 The advanced file upload field available in the Caldera Forms form builder is an alternative to our regular [file field upload fields.](https://calderaforms.com/doc/file-upload-fields/) While the regular file fields use the native HTML file uploader — the advanced file upload fields have a custom, and a better user interface. They also can be targeted with custom CSS.

 While regular file upload fields support multiple file uploads, we strongly recommend you use an advanced file field if you need multiple file uploads from the same field in your form.

 Advanced fields upload fields allow your users to add one or more files. Multiple uploads can be enabled with the “Allow Multiple” option.

 These files become attachments in the WordPress media library, and can optionally be attached to emails sent with the Caldera Forms mailer. Attaching to emails is enabled with the “Attach To Mailer” option.

= Does Caldera Forms Have Gravatar Fields? =
The Gravatar field displays a users universal avatar based on their input to an email field. This field type binds to an email address field and dynamically shows the Gravatar for the email address. You can add these fields to your form from the form builder interface with a simple drag and drop. These form fields provide a nice bit of "wow" to your WordPress form as they automatically display the user's gravatar when they enter an email in an email field that matches their Gravatar user name.

= Does Caldera Forms Have HTML Fields With Dynamic Fields ? =

Caldera Forms comes with an HMTL field type. This is not an input field but rather a content block for displaying HTML on the form. This is useful for adding instructions, creating breaks or simply making the form look a little better.

One of the nicest features about the HTML block is that it supports dynamic field binding. This allows you to use field references as %field_slug% in the HTML block. These references are then dynamically updated as the form is filled in.

This is a very cool feature of the Caldera Forms form builder. With this you can create a field that shows a preview of form submissions that is updated dynamically with values from one, some or all of the fields you have added to your form using the form builder.

= Does Caldera Forms Have Radio Button Fields? =
Yes, the Caldera Forms form builder has radio button fields and a variety of other types of select fields.

The radio field, like the [Dropdown Select Field](http://docs.calderaforms.com/dropdown-select/ "Dropdown Select"), allows for a user to select a single option while seeing all options at once. The “inline” option in the field configuration can be used to make the options show in a horizontal, instead of a vertical list. Options are added to your WordPress form one option at a time, or many at a time using the bulk inserter. Bulk inserting opens a textarea. Each line is an option. Clicking insert options creates the list.

You can auto-populate field options with just a few clicks in our form builder. The built in sources are:

*   Post-Type : This will create an option for every post of the selected type
*   Taxonomy : This will create an option for every term of the selected type

The auto-populate can be extended using the `caldera_forms_render_get_field_type-checkbox` filter.

= Is Caldera Forms A Great Choice For WordPress Contact Forms ? =
Yes, Caldera Forms is a great choice for creating contact forms on your WordPress site. Yes, it has tons of super powerful features, but even if you just need a simple contact form, you're going to want to make sure your contact form is accessible, that your contact form is responsive and that your contact form is beautiful. Caldera Forms does that and more for your contact forms. You also get multiple auto-responders for your contact forms, database storage of entries to your contact form all for free. You could even add mailing list sign up to your contact form when integrating your contact form with MailChimp, Aweber or Convertkit add-ons.

Make your WordPress contact forms the best contact forms with Caldera Forms for free!

= Does Caldera Forms Have Dropdown Select Fields ? =
Yes, it does, over course it does. What kind of WordPress form builder would not?

The dropdown select is for selecting a single option from a list. The configuration panel for the dropdown select field is much the same as all the [Select Option](http://docs.calderaforms.com/category/field-types/select-options/) types: Auto-Populate, and Options. Options are added in the Caldera Forms form builder one option at a time, or using the bulk inserter. Bulk inserting opens a textarea. Each line is an option. Clicking insert options creates the list.

Select Option type fields have an option to auto-populate. These fields can be auto-populated from a data source. The built in sources are:

*   Post-Type: This will create an option for every post of the selected type
*   Taxonomy: This will create an option for every term of the selected type

The auto-populate can be extended using the `caldera_forms_render_get_field_type-checkbox` filter.

As of Caldera Forms 1.4.3, you can also use the result of an [Easy Queries](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-easy-queries/) or [Easy Pods](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-easy-pods/) query for auto-populating select fields.

Options are added an option at a time, or using the bulk inserter. Bulk inserting opens a textarea. Each line is an option. Clicking insert options creates the list. This is the fastest way to add options to a select field with our form builder.

= Does Caldera Forms Have Checkbox Fields? =
Yep. You can use the Caldera Forms form builder to add checkox fields to your WordPress form.

Checkboxes can be used as a multi-select list, or a single toggle. The configuration panel for the checkbox is much the same as all the Select field types that are supported by our form builder: Auto-Populate, and Options.

 With checkbox fields you have an option in the form builder to make the options display either stacked, or side by side. This option in the Caldera Forms form builder is labelled as "inline" ?

 = Can I Get Some Caldera Forms Stickers ? =
 Do you think Caldera Forms is a great free WordPress form builder and want to show it off your love in sticker form? We have two types of stickers as of version 1.4.3 - Tweet [@CalderaWP](http://twitter.com/calderawp) about how much you love our form builder & then ask politely for a sticker and we will send you one. Or come see us at WordCamp and we'll have all sorts of stickers for you to show off your love for Caldera Forms -- the awesome drag and drop responsive form builder for WordPress.

= Does Caldera Forms Have Calculation Fields ? =
Yep, and they are one fo the coolest features of our form builder. Caldera Forms calculation fields are mainly used for calculating and displaying total prices based on form input. Calculation fields have two modes: visual and manual. The visual editor is a simple way to add, subtract, multiply and divide the values of fields or variables.

In manual mode, you can create complex formulas. In manual mode, you can use any valid [JavaScript arithmetic operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators). Field or variable values can be used via [magic tags](https://calderaforms.com/doc/using-magic-tags-caldera-forms/).

For security reasons, calculation fields are processed both in the browser and then again on the server during submission. The calculations are processed in the browser so their results can be update live providing a great experience to your customers. The calculations are re-run during submission to prevent tampering.

For this reason, it is important that when [using magic tags based on GET variables](https://calderaforms.com/doc/using-magic-tags-caldera-forms#get-magic) to not use them directly in the calculation. Instead, create a hidden field, set its value with the magic tag and then use that hidden field in the calculation.


* Notes On Manual Calculations

Manual calculations are use JavaScript math functions. You should not use Math. In front of your functions or you will create an error. For example, to multiply the value of a field with the slug field_1 by the value of a field with the slug field_2 raised to the second power, you would use `%field_1% * pow(%field_2%, 2 )`.

Also keep in mind that you should not end your formula with a semicolon. You also can not use any variables or call other types of functions.

= What Kind Of Cool Button Fields Does Caldera Forms Have ? =
The Caldera Forms form builder supports 5 button types for use in your WordPress forms.

The primary use for the Button field it to trigger the form submission. Buttons can also be used to move to the next, or previous page of a multi-page form.

A form intended for user submission requires a button of the type “submit” Without one, a form cannot be submitted. The button config panel is fairly simple, allowing you to set the name, slug, custom class (wrapper class), type and class (actual button class)

**Button Types**

A button can be set as a Submit, Button, Next Page, Previous Page & Reset.

*   Submit  - On click, will trigger the form to be submitted. If any required fields are not filled in, User will be prompted to fill them in.
*   Button - Used for more custom uses like javascript triggers.
*   Next Page - Triggers pagination to the next available page in a multi-page form.
*   Previous Page - Triggers pagination to the previous page in a multi-page form.
*   Reset - Resets the form to its load state. If returned to the form due to an invalid data, the reset will return it to this state, not an empty state.

Classes

A button config can be given 2 custom classes:

*   Custom Class - This class name is added to the div around the actual button element
*   Class - This class name is added to the actual button element

Since the form is based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), built in [button classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons) do apply (provided style includes are enabled)

CSS Tips For Buttons

Buttons in a Caldera Form default to carrying the class “btn” and all Caldera Forms are wrapped in an element with the class “caldera-grid”. Therefore you can target all buttons in your form with “.caldera-grid .btn”

[Here are some examples for changing Caldera Forms button - including submit button - color, width or centering the button](https://assets-cdn.github.com/assets/gist-embed-9ec60d02ee0eb30530c9c2d12055b82db581fbb13b64b807fd63df9cd276d21b.css)

Note that these examples will change all buttons in the form. If you want to target one button, you will need to switch to using the button ID.

= Does Caldera Forms Have A WYSIWYG / Rich Editor Field ? =

**Rich Editor WYSIWYG Fields are available in the form builder new feature in Caldera Forms 1.5.0.**
Caldera Forms offers Rich Editor fields that offer a What You See Is What You Get fields (WYSIWYG) experience. These fields allow those interacting with your WordPress form to easily craft HTML with out writing any code. But they can if they want.

These fields are excellent for creating or editing post content using the [Caldera Custom Fields add-on](https://calderaforms.com/downloads/caldera-form-custom-fields/) to create a front-end editor.

These fields are powered by the [Trumbowyg](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/) JavaScript library.

Setting Up The Field

User Interface Options

Rich editor fields have the standard form field options of other forms fields in the Caldera Forms form builder. In addition they have these three fields:

*   **Default **: This is a text area, for the default value of the field. It is [magic ta](https://calderaforms.com/doc/using-magic-tags-caldera-forms/)g enabled.
*   **Language Code **: By default, this field’s interface is in English. You can enter a supported language code here to change the language.
    *   [Click here for documentation on creating your own translation](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/documentation.html#add-localization).
    *   **Sanitization Level **: This sets the type of HTML tags that are allowed. Developers should [see this section](#developer-info) for more information.

### Language Codes

The following language codes are supported:

*   ar
*   ca
*   cs
*   da
*   de
*   el
*   es
*   es_ar
*   fa
*   fi
*   fr
*   he
*   hr
*   hu

*   rs_latin
*   ru
*   sk
*   sv
*   tr
*   ua
*   vi
*   zh_cn
*   zh_tw

### Additional Information For Developers

Before saving to the database, the field’s value is sanitized using [wp_kses](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_kses). The “permissive” setting for **Sanitization Level** will cause the “post” context to be used via [wp_kses_allowed_html](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_kses_allowed_html). The “restrictive” option will caused the “data” context to be used. You can filter allowed tags using [the wp_kses_allowed_html filter](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_kses_allowed_html).

The [Trumbowyg](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/) JavaScript library is used for WYSIWYG fields created using the Caldera Forms form builder. The options passed to [Trumbowyg](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/) when instantiating it on the field can be modified using the [caldera_forms_wysiwyg_options](https://calderaforms.com/doc/caldera_forms_wysiwyg_options) filter.

= What Does The Error ' Submission rejected, token invalid ' Mean?
This happens because the validation token -- a WordPress nonce -- could not be verified. This happens mainly because a caching plugin or CDN, such as Cloudflare is in use and caches the pages for longer than the WordPress nonce life -- by default 12 hours.

To fix this issue, set a cache exclusion for the page with your form or set a cache life of less than 12 hours.

This could also be a sign of a more serious issue on your server, but is probably cache related.
