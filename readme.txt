== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Are My Caldera Forms Going to Display Properly on All Types of Devices? =

Yes. Caldera forms is responsive by design. With Caldera Forms' drag and drop layout editor, you can easily create multi-column layouts for desktop that will display properly on mobile devices thanks to our responsive bootstrap-driven design.

= Is Caldera Forms Protected Against Spam? =

Yes your forms are protected against spam submissions by default. We use a honeypot instead of a captcha because captchas are less effective than honeypots and captchas are bad for conversions.   You can also use our [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) processor for anti-spam, which is available when Akismet is active on your site. You can also use [Spam Shield](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-spamshield/).   On our own sites, we just use the default anti-spam and we find this to be over 99% effective.

= Can I Send One or More Emails With Each Form Submission? =

Yes, we have many options for sending emails on each submission of your form. Caldera Forms provides an [email notification](https://calderawp.com/doc/setting-caldera-forms-email-notification?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms), which is turned on by default. In addition you can add one or more [auto-responder processors](https://calderawp.com/doc/using-caldera-forms-auto-responder-processor?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) to your forms.

= Why Is Caldera Form So Awesome? Seriously, Even Its Free Version Has So Many Great Features! =

Because we are awesome:)   We set out to make a different kind of WordPress form builder.

It's no secret that there are a lot of established leaders in this field. But we think that by starting with no conceptions of what a WordPress form builder should be or how it works, we were able to make something special.   We strive to provide a solid core product that can be used for free in hopes that you will use it, and think it is awesome. If you would like to support our work please consider purchasing one of our [Caldera Forms add-ons](https://calderawp.com/caldera-forms-add-ons?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms), a [cost-saving Caldera Forms bundles](https://calderawp.com/caldera-forms-bundles/?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) or one of our other fine WordPress plugins including [Easy Pods](https://calderawp.com/downloads/caldera-easy-pods/), [Easy Queries](https://calderawp.com/downloads/caldera-easy-queries/) and [Ingot](https://IngotHQ.com).  

= How Can I Send an Email to More Than One Person?  =

There are a lot of ways to send more than one email with Caldera forms.

 If you'd like to send two different emails, for example, one email with all of the submission details to the site owner and an auto-response message to the person who filled out the form. In this situation, you can use the main email notification to send to you and then use the [auto-responder processor](https://calderawp.com/doc/using-caldera-forms-auto-responder-processor?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) to send a simple "thank you, we will be in touch" message to the person who filled out the form.

 If you use the starter contact for form template to create a form this is already set up for you. Simply add your email address as the recipient in the email tab and you're ready to go.   You can add more than one auto-responder processor to your form. Since these processors can make use of Caldera Forms conditional logic, you can add multiple auto-responder processors and set them to run or not run based on form input.

= How Can I Save And View Forms Submissions? =

 Form submission tracking in your WordPress database, is a core feature of Caldera Forms. It is turned on for forms by default. You can turn it off from the settings tab of the form editor. When enabled all form entry data, with certain exceptions -- such as credit card numbers -- for security reasons, is saved.   You can view this information from the Caldera Forms admin page. You may optionally enable, form the form settings tab, a sub-menu page of the Caldera Forms menu page that will show entry data. You can choose to make these sub-menu pages available to users of other roles besides admins.  

= Can You Use Caldera Forms to Create a Event Registration Form? =

 Oh yes you can. Caldera forms is excellent for this if you need to accept payments for the event, you can use one of our [many payment processors](https://calderawp.com/caldera-forms-add-ons?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms). If you need to register users, you can use our [users add-on](https://calderawp.com/downloads/caldera-forms-users-add?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms).  

= Can I Use Caldera Forms For Front-end Editing Of Users? =

Yes, you can. Our [users add-on](https://calderawp.com/downloads/caldera-forms-users-add?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms) can register users, login users and even be used to edit user profiles. [Matt Cromwell](https://www.mattcromwell.com/) has [an excellent tutorial](https://www.mattcromwell.com/building-front-end-profile-editor-caldera-forms/) on using Caldera Forms for front-end editing of user profiles.  

= Can I Use Caldera Forms For Front-end Editing Of Posts? =

Yes, you can. Our plugin [Caldera Custom Fields ](https://calderawp.com/downloads/caldera-form-metabox?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms)allows you to use Caldera Forms to edit or create posts of any post type, and their custom fields. [Mike Hemberger](http://thestizmedia.com) has an [excellent post on creating a WordPress front-end editor with Caldera Forms](http://thestizmedia.com/front-end-post-editing-with-caldera-forms/).  

= Does Caldera Form Support Multi Page Forms? =

Oh, yes it does. By default Caldera Forms supports multi-page forms.  This is a core feature.

Multi-page forms are loaded on one page. This way of creating multi-page forms is simple to use and excellent for shorter, less complicated forms. We also offer a[ Connected Forms add-on](https://calderawp.com/downloads/caldera-forms-connector?utm_source=dotOrg&utm_medium=plugins&utm_campaign=caldera-forms), which allow you to combine multiple Caldera Forms into a sequence of forms. The advantage of this method is that a connected form sequence can have conditional logic.  So for example, if one form asks your user select that they want to pay now or pay later, you can take them to a credit card payment form or a form to arrange payment details.

In addition, Connected Forms tracks partial submissions between each step in the form sequence allow users to come back to where they left off in the sequence.

== Screenshots ==
1. **Layout Builder** - Easy to use Drag & Drop grid based layout.
2. **Form Processors** - With many processors available and more coming, each form can handle submissions in very unique and powerful ways.
3. **Stackable, condition based Form Processors** - Add as many form processors as needed and add conditions for each to create specific processing flow based on user input.
4. **Great Looking Forms** - Create great looking forms.
