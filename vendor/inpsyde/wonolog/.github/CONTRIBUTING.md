# Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* See if your issue has been discussed (or even fixed) earlier. You can [search for existing issues](../../../issues?q=is%3Aissue).
* Assuming it does not already exist, [create a new issue](../../../issues/new).
  * Clearly describe the issue. In case you want to report a bug, include steps to reproduce it.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

# Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the `master` branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on the `master` branch:
    * `git checkout -b issue/%YOUR-ISSUE-NUMBER%_%DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE% master`
    * a good example is `issue/123_typo_in_readme`
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are helpful.

# Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to the according topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* [Create a pull request](../../../compare) to our repository.
* Wait for feedback. The team looks at pull requests on a regular basis.
