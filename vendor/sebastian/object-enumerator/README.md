Traverses array structures and object graphs to enumerate all referenced objects.

## Installation

To add Object Enumerator as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `sebastian/object-enumerator` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Object Enumerator 1.0:

    {
        "require": {
            "sebastian/object-enumerator": "~1.0"
        }
    }
