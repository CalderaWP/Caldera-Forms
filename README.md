### JavaScript Development
[See automated testing docs for more information on directory structure, in regards to JavaScript test files]()

Run watcher for development to auto-compile JavaScript and CSS.

#### `/clients/`

* Clients:
    * pro - The Caldera Forms Pro admin page and tab in the editor.
    * blocks - The Gutenberg block(s).
    * admin - The main admin page. Work in progress, not used in plugin.
    * viewer - The entry viewer. Work not in progress, not used in plugin.
    * editor - Theoretical.

    -  `npm run build:webpack`
    
#### `/assets/`
This is the old stuff, built with grunt.
