## Development
[Contributor Guidleines](https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)


### Install for development
Requires: git, npm, Grunt.
- Clone repo to plugin directory
    - `git clone git@github.com:CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms.git`
- Switch directory
    - `cd Caldera-Forms.git`
- If you are using your own local development environment:
    - `npm i && composer install`
- If you are wish to use the provided local development environment
    - `composer dev:install`
    
    
### Build For Release
To create a build to ship to WordPress.org:
`npm run package`

This creates `/build/<version>` where `<version>` is the current version set in `package.json`. This creates a directory you can ZIP up for testing or whatever.

See "Release To WordPress.org" section below for more details on pushing this build to WordPress.org. 

### JavaScript Development

Run watcher for development to auto-compile JavaScript and CSS.

#### `/clients/`
This is the new stuff, built with webpack. Eventually everything UI will be here.

* Clients:
    * pro - The Caldera Forms Pro admin page and tab in the editor.
    * blocks - The Gutenberg block(s).
    * admin - The main admin page. Work in progress, not used in plugin.
    * viewer - The entry viewer. Work not in progress, not used in plugin.
    * editor - Theoretical.

* Build for development and start watcher.
    - `npm run dev`
* Build for production
    -  `npm run build:webpack`
    
#### `/assets/`
This is the old stuff, built with grunt.


* Build for development and start watcher.
    - `npm run dev:grunt`
* Build for production
    -  `npm run build:grunt`
    
### Test Environment
All PHP tests are based off of the WordPress "unit" test suite, and therefore need a full WordPress test environment. The install script in '/bin' is pretty standard and should work with VVV or whatever.

We provide a docker-based development environment. It is recommended that you use this environment because the setup is scripted and all of the tests can be run with it.

The local server is [http://localhost:8228](http://localhost:8228)


#### Requirements
* Docker
    - [Installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* Composer
    - [Installation documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
* npm
    - [Installation documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
    
    
#### Install Test Environment
* Install local development environment, dependencies and setup test forms
    - `composer dev:install`
        -  May take awhile.
* Go to [http://localhost:8228](http://localhost:8228) and make sure you have a WordPress site and can login.
    - Username: admin
    - password: password

### Test Structures
* PHP tests go in /tests and are run using phpunit
    - Integration tests, which require WordPress, are in tests. These used to be all the tests we have.
    - Unit tests -- isolated tests that do NOT require WordPress -- go in `tests/Unit`.
    - The trait `calderawp\calderaforms\Util\Traits` should have all of the factories used for integration and unit tests (aspirational.)
* JavaScript UNIT tests go in clients/tests
    - Unit tests go in clients/tests/unit and are run using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html)
    - Unit tests must have the word test in file name. For example, `formConfig.test.js`
* End to end tests go in `cypress/integration` amd are written using [Cypress](https://cypress.io)
    - See our [Cypress README for testing](./cypress/README.md)

#### Commands
##### Composer
* `composer test:php` - Run PHP tests -- isolated unit tests and the WordPress integration tests.
* `composer dev:install` - Installs dependencies, Docker-based test environment and sets up test forms.
* `composer dev:destroy` - Deletes dependencies and the Docker-based test environment.
* `composer wp:install` - Installs Docker-based test environment.
* `composer wp:start` - Starts Docker-based test environment and echos the server's url.
* `composer wp:server-start` - Starts Docker-based test environment.
* `composer wp:server-url` - Echos the Docker-based test environment's server url.
* `composer wp:activate` - Activate plugins in Docker-based environment.
* `composer wp:tests` - Runs the PHP integration tests using phpunit inside Docker-based environment .
* `composer wp:stop` - Stops Docker-based test environment, without destroying containers.
* `composer wp:destroy` - Removes (including the database) the test environment and destroys containers.
* `composer test:setup` - Adds test forms and puts them on pages.
* `composer test:delete` - Delete test forms and pages the are on.

* `npm run test:e2e` - Start Cypress e2e test runner.
* `npm run test:e2e:ci` - Trigger Cypress.io test record.

##### wp-cli
Probably don't use these directly. They will change. Must be prefaced with `docker-compose run --rm cli`
* `wp cf import-test-forms` - Import test forms
* `wp cf delete-test-forms` - Delete test forms
* `wp cf create-test-pages` - Import test pages
* `wp cf delete-test-pages` - Delete test pages
